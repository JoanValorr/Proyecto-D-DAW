      <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
      <p>
        Imagination is a key ingredient of Dungeons & Dragons, a cooperative game in which the characters that you roleplay embark on adventures together in fantasy worlds filled with monsters and magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>D&DAW</strong>, the action takes place in the imaginations of the players, and it’s narrated by everyone together.

      <h2>Adventures</h2>
      <p>
        An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased (the examples of play in this chapter are inspired by a published adventure, <em>Curse of Strahd</em>). In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, such as an underground dungeon, a wondrous wilderness, or a magic-filled city.
      </p>
      <p>
        During an adventure, the adventurers explore environments, events, and creatures presented by the DM. Battles, traps, negotiations, mysteries, and more arise during these explorations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges and take only one session to complete. A long adventure might involve many combats, interactions, and other challenges and take dozens of sessions.

      <h2>Ability Checks</h2>
      <p>
        An ability check represents a creature using talent and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertaining a crowd, or deciphering a cipher.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DM and the rules often call for an ability check when a creature attempts something other than an attack that has a chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice determine the result.
      </p>
