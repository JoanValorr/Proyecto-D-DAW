# Character *Classes*

## How to get started

Character class provides a characterâ€™s most exciting capabilities. This chapter offers twelve classes, each of which contains four subclassesâ€”all summarized below.


The heroes Mercion, Molliver, Strongheart, and Ringlerun protect a portal to another plane from diabolical invaders.

## Barbarian

Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a **Rage**. More than a mere emotionâ€”and not limited to angerâ€”this Rage is an incarnation of a predatorâ€™s ferocity, a stormâ€™s fury, and a seaâ€™s turmoil.

Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.

Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection donâ€™t have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.


### Barbarian Subclasses

- **Berserker:** to unleash raw violence.
- **Wild Heart:** to manifest kinship with animals.
- **World Tree:** to tap into cosmic vitality.
- **Zealot:** to rage in union with a god.

## Wizard

Wizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magicâ€™s inner workings. They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.

The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.

But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.
